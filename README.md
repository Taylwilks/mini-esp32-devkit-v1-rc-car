⚠️ Important Notes
Soldering Required: This build involves soldering, including directly to the ESP32 board. If you're not comfortable with soldering A jumper cable-compatible version may be released in the future.
-
Frame Version Recommendation: Print only Frame v3 or higher for optimal results. Earlier versions may be fragile or require additional adjustments.

🛠️ Materials Needed

.1x ESP32 Devkit V1

.2x N20 Motors

.1x DRV8833 Motor Driver Board (I recommend the smaller black version)

.1x Li-ion Battery (Rechargeable preferred)

.M2 Screws (Various sizes)

.JST Connectors

.Micro USB or USB-C Cable (Depending on your ESP32 board)

.Double-Sided Tape (Or fold regular tape over itself)

.Stranded Core Insulated Wire (Various lengths)

.hot glue or super glue


🖨️ Step 1: Print the Frame
-
Download the provided STL files or click this link to take you to the maker world site    ( link coming soon ).

Note: Earlier frame versions (v1 and v2) are experimental and may not perform well.
Use Frame v3 or above for the best durability and fit.
Print the files using your preferred 3D printer.

🔌 Step 2: Flash the Firmware
-
Download the firmware (currently under development).
Use the Arduino IDE (or another tool compatible with ESP32) to upload the code.
Firmware status: Not yet available (expected soon).
Updates and troubleshooting will be added once the firmware is ready.

🛠️ Step 3: Assemble the Components
-
(Details on assembly coming soon :)       )

💡 Tips and Future Updates
-
A jumper cable-compatible version is under consideration for those who want a solder-free experience.
