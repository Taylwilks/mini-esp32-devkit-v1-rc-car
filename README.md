‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Soldering Required: This build involves soldering, including directly to the ESP32 board. If you're not comfortable with soldering A jumper cable-compatible version may be released in the future.
-
Frame Version Recommendation: Print only Frame v3 or higher for optimal results. Earlier versions may be fragile or require additional adjustments.

üõ†Ô∏è Materials Needed

.1x ESP32 Devkit V1

.2x N20 Motors

.1x DRV8833 Motor Driver Board (I recommend the smaller black version)

.1x Li-ion Battery (Rechargeable preferred)

.M2 Screws (Various sizes)

.JST Connectors

.Micro USB or USB-C Cable (Depending on your ESP32 board)

.Double-Sided Tape (Or fold regular tape over itself)

.Stranded Core Insulated Wire (Various lengths)

.hot glue or super glue


üñ®Ô∏è Step 1: Print the Frame
-
Download the provided STL files or click this link to take you to the maker world site    ( link coming soon ).

Note: Earlier frame versions (v1 and v2) are experimental and may not perform well.
Use Frame v3 or above for the best durability and fit.
Print the files using your preferred 3D printer.

üîå Step 2: Flash the Firmware
-
Download the firmware (currently under development).
Use the Arduino IDE (or another tool compatible with ESP32) to upload the code.
Firmware status: Not yet available (expected soon).
Updates and troubleshooting will be added once the firmware is ready.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Assemble the Components
-
.1: first of all you will need to remove the suports from the print ( if you can print it to need less suports good on you )

.2: solder the out+ of the tp4056 to the in+ of the boost converter 
.3: place the battery in the space under the esp32 slot feeding the two leads under the esp32 slot ( make sure the two leads dont touch )
.4: solder the + and - wires of the battery to the respective pads on the tp4056 labeld B+ and B-
.5: eather glue ore tape the two boards to the undeside of the frame 
.6: solder two leads to each of the motors exposed pins (to make your life easier use two distinked colors) giving one motor wires about 2cm long and the other about 6cm long
.7: connect the other end of the wires to the drv8833 (make sure to group the motor wires E.G. motor 1 - out 1 - 2)

üí° Tips and Future Updates
-
A jumper cable-compatible version is under consideration for those who want a solder-free experience.
